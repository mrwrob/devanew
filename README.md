This is the system used for the study that investigated whether there is a difference in how people react emotionally to different types of words, depending on the professional context.

The sysem allows to assess the emotions posed by the words, as if they occurred in bug tracking systems, commits' descriptions or comments in the source code of the application. 

The emotions evaluation is conducted using SAM figures. SAM shows three different kinds of feelings: Happy vs. Unhappy (top), Excited vs. Calm (middle), and Controlled vs. In-control (bottom).
